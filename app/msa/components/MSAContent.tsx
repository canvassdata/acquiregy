      <p className="font-medium">
        THIS MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT ("MSA") sets forth terms and conditions entered into by and between Acquiregy
        LLC, a California corporation ("Provider"), and Client executing a statement of work also executed by Provider
        and referencing this MSA (as applicable, the "Statement of Work" and together with this MSA, the "Agreement").
        Provider and Client may each be referred to herein as a "Party" and together as the "Parties". This MSA shall be
        effective as of the effective date of the Statement of Work.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article I – Statements of Work</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">1.1 Statements of Work.</p>
      <p>
        All work to be performed by Provider must be specified in an applicable Statement of Work. A Statement of Work
        shall not be effective unless fully executed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties, and Provider
        shall not be obligated to perform any work until such time.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">1.2 Adjustments.</p>
      <p>
        All statements and agreements concerning time, fees, and other expenses (including any fixed price or
        not-to-exceed quotations in the Statement of Work) are good faith estimates based upon information furnished by
        Client and circumstances existing at the time made. The Statement of Work is subject to equitable adjustment
        upon any material change in such information or circumstances, the occurrence of delays (as contemplated in
        Section 1.3 below), or modification of the scope, timing, or level of work to be performed by Provider. Client
        acknowledges that delays not attributable to Provider and/or any agreed change may affect the project or
        campaign schedule and/or the fees and expenses payable to Provider.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">1.3 Delays.</p>
      <p>
        Provider, or its subcontractors engaged to perform work hereunder, shall be excused from delays in performing or
        from a failure to perform the Agreement to the extent that such delays or failures result from causes beyond
        Provider's (or its subcontractors', as the case may be), reasonable control. Without limiting the generality of
        the foregoing, Client acknowledges that Client's failure or delay in furnishing necessary information or
        products, or failure by Client in completing tasks required of Client or in otherwise performing Client's
        obligations hereunder or under the Statement of Work, and any explicit assumption contained in the Statement of
        Work which is not met or is incorrect or otherwise fails to hold shall be considered an excusable delay or
        excusable failure to perform by Provider and may impede or delay completion of Services and/or result in
        additional fees and expenses chargeable to Client. In addition, if a Campaign (as defined in Section 2.4 below)
        is delayed by an aggregate number of thirty (30) days or more through no fault of Provider, then Provider may
        elect to terminate work under the Statement of Work.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">1.4 Postponement.</p>
      <p>
        Client must provide Provider with advance written notice of at least ten (10) days if it intends or expects to
        postpone the start date or any work contemplated in the Statement of Work.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">1.5 Designated Manager.</p>
      <p>
        Parties shall designate an individual manager to represent the implementation of the Statement of Work. Client
        may change its designated manager upon written notice to Provider. The designated Client manager shall be the
        primary point of contact for Client and responsible for the day-to-day coordination of activities between the
        Parties as contemplated by the Statement of Work.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">1.6 Change Requests.</p>
      <p>
        In the event that Client wishes to request a modification to the Statement of Work (including any scope, even if
        at no cost) (a "Change Request"), Client shall provide Provider with written notice detailing the requested
        changes. Provider shall then provide a written response estimating the impact, if any, that the requested
        modifications would have on the scope, schedule, fees, or other material terms in the Statement of Work.
        Provider may also propose Change Requests on its own initiative. Neither Party shall be compelled to agree to
        Change Requests. If the Parties agree to a Change Request, then such agreement must be reflected in a written
        change order indicating an amendment to the Statement of Work (a "Change Order"). No changes to the Statement of
        Work shall be effective absent a Change Order fully executed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties,
        and Provider shall not be obligated to modify or perform any additional work until such time. Provider shall
        continue performing services in accordance with the applicable Statement of Work unless and until the Parties
        agree in writing on the change in scope of work, scheduling, and fees therefor in a Change Order.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article II – Standard Services</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">2.1 Services.</p>
      <p>
        Provider may render those standard services specified in the Statement of Work, subject to this MSA and upon the
        terms and conditions of the Agreement ("Services").
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">2.2 Standard Services.</p>
      <p>
        Provider's standard services involve coordinating contract partners ("Influencers") who order a particular
        Client product ("Product") and may then complete a Qualifying Online Post (as defined in Section 2.3 below)
        after utilizing the Product. In connection with the Services, and for no additional consideration other than
        Client's having entered into the Agreement, Client hereby grants to Provider and all Influencers full permission
        to use the names, likeness, logos, trademarks, slogans, images, social media links, tags and/or handles, and
        descriptions of Client and its Products.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">2.3 Qualifying Online Posts.</p>
      <p>
        A "Qualifying Online Post" is a post, review, message, statement, publication, image, text, video, or other
        communication made by an Influencer on or through a generally known social media service, on a Client's website,
        on a seller's website, or otherwise on a publicly available site (such as, without limitation, a third-party
        review website or a hobby or special interest magazine website).
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">2.4 Campaigns.</p>
      <p>
        The provision of Services whereby Provider coordinates Influencers with respect to a particular Client Product
        for a period of time may be known as a "Campaign". Campaigns may be, but need not be, grouped and administered
        together as a "Program". Statements of Work should specify the target start date, duration, and end date of each
        Campaign or Program.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">2.5 Influencers.</p>
      <p>Provider shall have full and sole discretion as to which Influencers to retain.</p>

      <p className="font-medium">2.6 Influencer Posts.</p>
      <p>
        Provider makes no representations, warranties, or covenants as to or relating to posts, reviews, messages,
        statements, publications, or other communications by Influencers, whether or not constituting Qualifying Online
        Posts; except that Provider covenants that its standard contract form with Influencers will provide that
        Influencer shall grant to Client a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, transferable, and
        royalty-free right and license to copy, republish, and otherwise utilize all Qualifying Online Posts. Provider
        asserts no exclusive rights or ownership to Qualifying Online Posts; provided, however, Client agrees that
        Provider may copy, republish, or otherwise utilize all Qualifying Online Posts in any fashion Provider wishes.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">2.7 As-Is.</p>
      <p>
        Provider makes no representations, warranties, or covenants as to the quality of Influencers or Qualifying
        Online Posts, or as to the general success of any Campaign or Program. All Services (including, without
        limitation, Client's use of Provider's websites and related functionality) are rendered AS IS, AS AVAILABLE, and
        WITH ALL FAULTS and without warranty of any kind and will be accepted by Client at Client's sole risk.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article III – Supplemental or Special Services</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">3.1 Services.</p>
      <p>
        Provider may render additional or non-standard Services as specified in the Statement of Work, subject to this
        MSA and upon the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">3.2 Special Services.</p>
      <p>
        Any non-standard Services should be set forth in a Statement of Work including, at a minimum, the scope of
        Services and deliverables, the project/work schedule, and associated fees, and should also set out any
        estimates, assumptions, conditions, dependencies, phases/milestones, furnished products, third-party solutions,
        and accepting, testing, and completion criteria if and as applicable and material. Unless otherwise set forth on
        a Statement of Work, any Services rendered to Client may be invoiced on a time and materials basis with Provider
        time charged at its then-prevailing standard rates.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article IV – Fees and Invoicing</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">4.1 In General.</p>
      <p>
        Fees for Services (and if applicable, deliverables, furnished products, or third-party solutions) payable to
        Provider should be set forth in the Statement of Work. Any work performed by Provider which is outside the scope
        of work in the Statement of Work and ordered by Client or is performed by Provider due to a breach by Client or
        a postponement or delay or failure of an assumption or condition not due to the fault of Provider, shall be
        charged at Provider's then-prevailing standard rates on a time-and-materials basis. Provider may require a
        deposit before commencing Services.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.2 Fees for Standard Services.</p>
      <p>
        The Statement of Work may provide for compensation to Provider based on the duration of the Campaign or Project,
        based upon the number of Influencers, based upon the number of Influencers submitting at least one Qualifying
        Online Post, or based upon the number of Qualifying Online Posts, or otherwise as the Parties may agree. In
        addition to, or in the alternative, a Statement of Work may provide for a management fee payable to Provider
        regardless of the number of Influencers or Qualifying Online Posts.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.3 Influencer Purchase Reimbursements.</p>
      <p>
        Provider's standard services program contemplates Influencers purchasing Client's Products, and then Influencers
        being reimbursed by Provider for Product purchase costs if and when they make Qualifying Online Posts
        ("Qualifying Purchase Reimbursements"). In addition to the fees contemplated above, Client shall pay to Provider
        amounts equal to the amounts Provider reimbursed Influencers for their purchases of Products.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.4 Expenses.</p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, Client shall also be responsible for reimbursing Provider
        all the pre-approved expenses incurred for travel, lodging, and other ancillary out-of-pocket expenses or items
        paid or incurred in performing Services; provided, however, that Provider shall obtain Client's approval for any
        expenses which are not scheduled or otherwise contemplated in the Statement of Work.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.5 Reports.</p>
      <p>
        Within thirty (30) days after the end of a Campaign or Program, Provider may create a final report with respect
        to the Campaign or Program which indicates: the number of Influencers, the number of Qualifying Online Posts,
        Qualifying Purchase Reimbursements, and the determination of Provider fees, Qualifying Purchase Reimbursements,
        and other costs, expenses, and interest pursuant to the Agreement, such being applied to any outstanding deposit
        balance with the remainder being payable by Client to Provider.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.6 Invoicing.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, Provider may invoice Client monthly.</p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.7 Credit Balances.</p>
      <p>
        If a Statement of Work required a Client deposit for a particular Campaign or Project and Client has an account
        credit balance after the end of such Campaign or Project (as shown on the final report therefor), then Provider
        shall refund such credit balance to the Client unless Client instructs otherwise.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.8 Payments.</p>
      <p>
        Payments are due within fifteen (15 days) from the date of invoice. Payments shall be made via credit card or
        via wire or other electronic transfer of immediately available funds according to instructions on the invoice.
        In the event payment is not received within such forty five-day period, Provider may charge interest on amounts
        outstanding at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or the highest rate allowable by applicable law, whichever
        is less. If Client in good faith disputes any portion of any invoice, then Client shall timely submit payment to
        Provider for the undisputed portion of such invoice and promptly provide written documentation identifying the
        disputed portion and supporting Client's position, and the Parties shall then exercise reasonable efforts to
        conference within ten (10) days in an attempt to identify and potentially resolve disagreements. If the Parties
        are unable to resolve disagreements, then the matter shall be further handled as a Dispute subject to Section
        9.11 below, subject to Section 4.9.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.9 Non-Exclusive Remedies.</p>
      <p>
        If a payment not subject to good faith dispute is over forty five (45) days late, or if a payment subject to
        good faith dispute is over ninety (90) days late, then Provider, in its sole discretion and in addition to any
        other remedies available to it herein or otherwise under law, may (i) initiate the Dispute resolution process,
        (ii) take other action to collect payment, and/or (iii) stop work and re-assign its personnel and other
        resources. Client shall reimbursement for all of Provider's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
        fees) incurred in investigating the matter and attempting to collect any amounts past due under the Agreement,
        and all costs associated with work stoppages for late payment shall be borne fully by Client. Nothing herein
        shall in any way limit or waive any remedies or relief (including, without limitation, injunctive relief)
        available under law to Provider.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">4.10 Taxes.</p>
      <p>
        Client shall pay all taxes, assessments, and fees applicable in connection with the Services, whether national,
        federal, state, or local, including, without limitation, sales, use, value-add, excise, personal property,
        customs fees, import duties, stamp duties, and any other similar taxes and duties, however designated or levied;
        provided, however, Provider shall be responsible for its own taxes on net income. Provider shall invoice Client
        for any taxes properly payable by Client that are required to be collected by Provider pursuant to any
        applicable statute, rule, regulation, or other requirement of law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article V – Certain Restrictive Covenants</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">5.1 Confidentiality.</p>
      <p>
        Each Party (as applicable, a "Recipient") agrees to retain in strict confidence any information provided to it
        by the other Party (as applicable, a "Discloser") that is marked, labeled, or otherwise designated as
        confidential or proprietary or that Recipient knew, or reasonably should have known, was confidential due to the
        circumstances surrounding the disclosure by Discloser ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information
        shall not include any information that (i) is generally known to the public at the time of disclosure, (ii) is
        received by Recipient without restriction from a third party without any breach by such third party of any
        confidentiality, fiduciary, or other obligation to the Discloser, (iii) is published or otherwise made known to
        the public by Discloser, or (iv) is generated independently by the Recipient without use of or reference to
        Discloser's confidential information. Furthermore, Client acknowledges and agrees that the Agreement itself and
        all information, materials, and content related to the Services and the types of services the Provider offers is
        Confidential Information except as pursuant to Section 5.3 below. Recipient shall use at least the same standard
        of care with Discloser's Confidential Information as it does with its own Confidential Information, but in no
        event with less than reasonable care. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information in order to respond to a
        valid order of a court or other governmental body or any political subdivision thereof, or as otherwise required
        by law, provided that the Recipient (A) informs Discloser as soon as reasonably practicable of the required
        disclosure, (B) limits the disclosure to the required purpose, and (C) at Discloser's request and expense,
        assists in an attempt to object to or limit the required disclosure. Upon termination or expiration of the
        Agreement, or upon Discloser's request, Recipient shall return or destroy all Confidential Information provided
        under the Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that breach of this provision by it would result in irreparable
        harm to the other Party, for which money damages would be an insufficient remedy, and therefore that the other
        Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Article V. The Parties
        hereby agree and acknowledge that this Article V supersedes any prior confidentiality agreements by and between
        the Parties with respect to Confidential Information disclosed after the effective date of this MSA. Nothing in
        this Section 5.1, however, is intended to prevent Provider from sharing information with Influencers.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">5.2 Non-Solicitation.</p>
      <p>
        Client covenants that during term of this MSA and for a period of one (1) year thereafter Client will not,
        directly or indirectly, through a corporation or other entity, unincorporated business, affiliated party,
        successor or assign, or otherwise, solicit, hire for employment or engagement, or work with, on a full-time,
        part-time, consulting, advising, or any other basis, any person who is, or was within the prior twelve months,
        an employee of Provider or any affiliate of Provider without prior written permission from Provider.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">5.3 Agreement Confidentiality.</p>
      <p>
        The content, terms, and provisions of this MSA and all Statements of Work shall remain strictly confidential;
        provided, however, that either Party may identify the existence of a business relationship between the Parties;
        and provided, further, that Provider may develop, utilize, and publish case studies and other information
        derived from or relating to Client, Programs, or Campaigns for internal or external marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">5.4 No Exclusivity.</p>
      <p>
        Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 5.1 above, Provider shall not be precluded from rendering
        services to other clients that are competitive with Client, irrespective of any similarity to the Client,
        Products, or materials which might be delivered to Client pursuant to the Agreement. Nothing in the Agreement
        shall be construed as precluding or limiting in any way the right of Provider to provide standard, nonstandard,
        consulting, development, or other services of any kind of nature whatsoever to any individual or entity as
        Provider in its sole and absolute discretion deems desirable.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">5.5 Residual Knowledge.</p>
      <p>
        Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 5.1, Client acknowledges that Provider and its employees
        and agents shall be free to use and employ their general skills, know-how, and expertise to use, disclose, and
        employ any generalized ideas, concepts, knowhow, methods, techniques, or skills gained or learned during the
        course of rendering any Services.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article VI – Disclaimer and Limitations</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">6.1 Third-Party Compliance.</p>
      <p>
        Provider makes no representation, warranty, or covenant of any kind, type, or nature concerning either Party's
        compliance with contracts, agreements, terms of service, policies, guidelines, codes of conduct, standards,
        rules, prohibitions, restrictions, or other terms or conditions with or of any third party including, without
        limitation, involving an online platform or service of a social media service, a third-party seller's website,
        seller service, reviewer, or other interest organization. It shall be Client's sole responsibility to identify,
        analyze, interpret, and comply with all third-party contracts and other obligations and ensure compliance
        therewith, as may involve Client, Client's Products, the Services, or Influencers and actions of Influencers
        involving the Client or any of its Products. Client hereby releases Provider and all Influencers from, and
        Client waives any and all claims or rights therein which it may have nor may have in the future with respect to
        any contracts, agreements, terms of service, policies, guidelines, codes of conduct, standards, rules,
        prohibitions, restrictions, or other terms or conditions with or of any third party (including, for example and
        without limitation, those of Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates).
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">6.2 Disclaimer.</p>
      <p>
        Provider DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, OR REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN)
        BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY,
        OR FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY KNOWS, HAS REASON TO KNOW, HAS BEEN
        ADVISED, OR IS OTHERWISE IN FACT AWARE OF ANY SUCH PURPOSE), WHETHER OR NOT ALLEGED TO ARISE BY STATUTE OR
        COMMON LAW OR OTHER LAW, BY REASON OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, OR BY COURSE OF DEALING, AND WHETHER EXPRESS
        OR IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE. IN ADDITION, Provider EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BASED ON,
        ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT TO ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL
        CLIENT PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT. CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES TO THE AFORESAID DISCLAIMERS.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">6.3 Limitation of Damages.</p>
      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT OTHERWISE TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL Provider BE
        LIABLE TO CLIENT OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR ANY
        OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST INCOME OR PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOST
        DATA OR RECORDS) OF ANY KIND BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
        AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. To the extent a particular applicable jurisdiction to which the
        Agreement may be subject does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, Provider's liability shall be limited to the maximum extended permitted by law.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">6.4 Limitation of Liability.</p>
      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT OTHERWISE TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL Provider's
        CUMULATIVE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT ANY DISPUTE ARISING HEREUNDER OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
        THE AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE OF AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO Provider UNDER THE APPLICABLE STATEMENT
        OF WORK.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium">6.5 Provider Personnel and Affiliates.</p>
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, the Provider disclaimers and limitations of liability in this Article VI also apply
        for the benefit and protection of Provider's members, managers, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
        subcontractors, vendors, service providers, and affiliates.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Article VII – Indemnification</h2>

      <p className="font-medium">7.1 By Client.</p>
      <p>
        Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Provider (and its members, managers, officers, employees,
        agents, representatives, subcontractors, vendors, service providers, and affiliates) from and against any and
        all claims, suits, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including expenses of investigation and reasonable
        attorneys' fees) that Provider (or any of its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
        subcontractors, vendors, service providers, or affiliates) incurs as a result of, arising from, based upon, or
        otherwise in connection with: (i) any intentional misconduct by Client (or any of its officers, employees,
        representatives, agents, subcontractors, assignees, or affiliates); (ii) a breach of this Agreement by Client;
        (iii) any claim, proceeding, or other action by a third party or a governmental authority involving a Product;
        (iv) any claim, proceeding, or other action by a third party or a governmental authority in connection with the
        Services (except to the extent of an intentional breach by Provider); or (vi) any breach of an obligation owed

        and affiliates) from and against any and all claims, suits, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including
        expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees) that Client (or any of its directors/managers,
        officers, employees, agents, representatives, subcontractors, vendors, service providers, or affiliates) incurs
        as a result of, arising from, based upon, or otherwise in connection with: (i) any intentional misconduct by

        or (ii) a breach of this Agreement by Provider.

      <p className="font-medium">7.3 Procedures.</p>
      <p>
        A Party entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 above (as applicable, the "Indemnified

        of such claim, and (C) give the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such
        claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that materially affects the
        Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval, which approval
        shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party duly and diligently
        defends a claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense, such

        chosen by the Parties to express their collective mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
        applied against either of them. Unless the context clearly suggests otherwise: (i) the singular includes the
        plural and the plural includes the singular; (ii) words shall include grammatically related forms; (iii) a

        and vice versa; (iv) the word "or" is not exclusive; (v) the words "include," "includes," and "including" are
        not limiting; and (vi) references to days mean calendar days. The titles, subtitles, and headings used in this

        Agreement. In the event of conflicting terms between this MSA and the Statement of Work, the terms of the

        remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
        invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. As to any provision which is held
        to be unenforceable because of the scope or duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, the Parties
        agree to modify such provision, and that any court or arbitrator making such determination shall have the power
        to modify such provision, to reduce the scope or duration or area of such provision, or both, or to delete
        specific words or phrases here from ("blue-penciling"), and, in its modified, reduced, or blue-penciled form,
